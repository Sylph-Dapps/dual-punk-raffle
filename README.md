# A Punk For You And Me

APunkForYouAndMe accepts ETH deposits until a particular target amount is reached. When that happens a raffle weighted by deposit size is run that selects a depositor as the winner. The owner of the contract and the winner can then use the collected ETH to each buy a Cryptopunk from the punks marketplace contract. The remaining ETH can then be withdrawn by depositors in prorportion to the amount they originally deposited.

E.g. The target is 150 ETH, and 100 people each deposit 1.5 ETH. The winner and the owner each buy a punk for 60 ETH, leaving 30 ETH in the contract. Each depositor can then withdraw 0.3 ETH.
